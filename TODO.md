# Todo (Ideas)
- If you are reading this dont get your hopes up - just possible ideas but nothing more atm.
- I plan todo a casual playthrough myself, any changes will be QOL or singular fun additions, no huge overhauls, no giant webs of coding.
- Centrifuge progress bar looks like 1 pixel to high on the y axis maybe?
- Computer Cube should be an in game Wiki for tiles. (Someday not soon, add compat for mods if that GTCX guy uses GTC???)
- Maybe make more viables ways of exploring to progress vs straight mining in caves.
- Possibly make redstone transmitter tiles and screens work interdimensionally
- Add tooltips for most items/tools
- Add Gregorius-Tree lol (use oak tree as base)
- Concrete Mixer - cheap and low power option for automating concrete production
- Fix flying onplayerlogin with an extra boolean to see if the player was flying instead of forcing the player to fly

# Maybe-do
- Fix Speiger's total apathy twoards rotated block textures - will be a PITA have to remove and redo facing implementation
- Multiplayer support for Basic Worktable.
- Redo Forge Fluid Transfer method to account for speigers dumb multi tanks
- FIX STUPID RECIPE DUPE/ERROR LOADING WARNINGS
- Make custom recipe modifer for fusion power out

# Bugs
- Try to reduce lag when setting the recipe in an autocrafter
- Optimize the Charge-O-Mat, and Bedrock Miner
